89	0	0	I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed.
90	0	0	Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and I am not kidding you, I called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them.
91	0	0	It's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them.
92	0	0	And at one point, they blame me for installing a bad memory###stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop (I bought the memory###stick they recomended).
93	0	0	Long###story###short, since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one, I didn't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop, but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year, they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services, they finally gave in.

103	0	0	even though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty.
104	0	0	Dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture.
105	0	0	English must have been his third or fourth language.
106	0	0	His language was so bad I swore I was taking the turing test, and it was failing.

110	0	0	After they found no other way, they told me to courier it to them(since they don't allow the use of the post office) at my expense, and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn't be covered.
111	0	0	I managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me.
112	0	0	They really do have the worlds very worst repair service.

159	6	1	iLife is easily compatible with Microsoft###Office so you can send and receive files from a PC.

166	0	0	When calling Dell for help, reurn, or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it.
167	4	0	NOW AM VERY APREHENSIVE ABOUT TOSHIBA LAPTOPS.
168	2	1	For example, when my husband turns the light out while I'm on the computer. the screen brightness automatically adjusts.
169	7	1	It is VERY easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted.
170	6	1	Its Office compatible, but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs.
171	3	1	Very long-life battery (up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings).
172	5	1	I play a lot of casual games online, and the touchpad is very responsive.
173	2	0	The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook: screen size is not something I'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week.
174	1	1	Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point.
175	3	1	Everything I have tried has worked and I never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome.

180	0	0	Toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done.

182	7	0	This computer that I have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions.
183	1	0	I wiped nearly everything off of it, installed OpenOffice and Firefox, and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price.
184	3	1	I use this for my tutoring business, and since I'm always bouncing from student to student, it is ideal for portability and battery life (yes, it gets the 8 hours as advertised!).
185	4	1	ASUS has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks, and I would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them.
186	0	0	I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba###Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty.
187	0	0	They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place.
188	0	0	And Toshiba is totally unconcerned.
189	0	0	The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter.

200	2	1	It's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook.
201	3	0	The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it's a lie.
202	3	0	I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it.
203	3	0	The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours.
204	3	0	Enabling the battery timer is useless.
205	3	0	The "Time remaining" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes.
206	3	0	It's so bad that I'm thinking I only got half a battery or something.
207	3	0	I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.

214	2	1	Its fast, has High###definition quality in the videos.
215	2	1	The pictures are clear as can be.
216	4	1	If I had to buy another computer, I would most definetly buy an acer one computer.
217	2	1	The acer one computer that I bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it, but I like the big screen on it.
218	6	0	The only downfall is a lot of the software I have won't work with Mac and iWork is not worth the price of it.
219	6	0	It seems to be incompatible with everything else.
220	6	1	the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm.
221	1	1	The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly.

235	6	0	Was not happy with one of the programs on it.
236	6	0	It was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer, was a six month trial.

266	1	0	I loved the netbook (minus the fact that it was windows###OS) until this started happening.
267	4	0	But if you can't make your product last more than a year, you will not get my business again.
268	0	1	In those three years, I've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by Apple quickly and easily.
269	6	1	The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product.
270	2	0	First the screen goes completely out.

281	1	1	It did not take long to get used to the Mac OS.
282	2	1	I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for (Internet, artwork), and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable.
283	6	1	iTunes is a handy music-management program, and it is essential for anyone with an iPod.
284	4	1	They definitely have a superior product!
285	0	0	Toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it.
286	0	0	I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired.
287	0	0	Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty.
288	4	1	My next laptop will also be a Mac!
289	6	1	The Final###Cut###Pro on this laptop is so fast and easy, and I can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer, which is also a mac.
290	7	1	I do transcription work on the side, and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well.
291	0	1	The apple care has never failed me, and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well.
292	4	1	I will only buy apple laptops from now on.
293	0	1	I have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free, even without the warranty.
294	6	1	The programs are great, like iphoto (love the editing capabilities), imail (which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad), imovie, etc.
295	6	1	She said its very user friendly.
296	6	1	I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing.
297	4	1	That was my first Apple product and since then I have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs I have bought.
298	5	1	Since I've had this computer I've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth.
299	5	1	I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad.
300	6	1	The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it (iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iTunes, GarageBand) is all very helpful as well.
301	0	0	Each time taking about 1 day or so.
302	0	0	I had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly.
303	0	0	I had to pay for the shipping!
304	4	0	I will never buy anything from HP again!
305	6	1	i use my mac all the time, i love the software, the way it takes a short time to load things, how easy it is to use and most of all how you don't have to worry about viruses.
306	0	1	All apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything, no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed.
307	1	1	everything about a mac is wonderful, it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system, but you will learn fast and its all worth it.
308	0	0	3) Horrible customer support-they lost my laptop for a month-got it back 3 months later
309	0	0	4) Laptop still did not work, blue###screen within a week...
310	4	0	this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this "never" happen...
311	4	1	I'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the 'old' way - and Apple does, indeed, have the better idea.
312	7	0	The letter A stopped working after the first week.
313	0	0	when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return###policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase.
314	0	0	so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault.
315	0	0	they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem.
316	0	0	they have not sent a new one nor called.
317	0	0	then on top of it all their cusromer service###center is in the middle east.
318	0	0	So when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand.
319	0	0	Then to make matters worst, there is noone that they can transfer you to.
320	0	0	Got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it.
321	0	0	3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications.
322	0	0	YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TALK TO AN AMERICAN WARRANTY SERVICE IS OUT OF COUNTRY.
323	0	0	That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed.
324	0	0	It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back.
325	5	0	ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke.
326	3	0	The battery life is probably an hour at best.
327	6	0	Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product###key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good.
328	3	0	Also, the battery does not last very long at all.
329	0	0	I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem.
330	7	0	Also, I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly.
331	7	0	Also, I have had alot of trouble with the shift###key to go to other lines.
332	7	0	It gets stuck all of the time you use it, and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work.
333	2	0	Sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer.
334	4	0	Will probably never buy a HP again.
335	0	0	None of the techs at HP knew what they were doing.
336	0	0	They would repair one thing, send it back and it would still have the same problem.
337	0	0	I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused, because they knew it was trouble.
338	0	0	I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty.
339	0	0	I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT.
340	0	0	I waited and waited and no laptop.
341	0	0	Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box.
342	0	0	I waited another month for approval and for them to "BUILD" me a new laptop.
343	0	0	Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing.
344	0	0	HP didn't fix it.
345	0	0	1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in.
346	0	0	They say sorry out of warranty.
347	0	0	Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period.
348	0	0	Now 17 months later they want (would not say exact amount) $165.00 to $400 to fix the machine.
349	0	0	They had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything.
350	0	0	Now the machine won't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook.
351	4	0	So buyer beware when buying Toshiba
352	0	0	I had to call Apple 19 times (each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone), and take it to their store for evaluations, and diagnostics, 5 times.
353	4	0	For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this).
354	4	0	Steve###Jobs, probably needs help and donations, and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby.
355	4	0	The lesson learned here is: It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand, since all of them are there to simply  to make as much money as possible, as fast as they can, and in this day and age, the customer no longer is right all the times.
356	0	1	So I called customer support (which is good too) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all, I just chose to hide the message.
357	0	0	I custom ordered the machine from HP and could NOT understand the techie due to his accent.
358	0	0	Although my model was listed as recalled, HP denied my claim.
359	6	0	I bought it from HSN because it was "bundled" with extra software, but as it turns out, that software just crashes it more often.....
360	0	0	Spent 2 hours on phone with HP Technical Support.
361	0	0	They went through asking me open up various components, taking battery out, hard###disk apart, and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it.
362	0	0	Called tech support and got the usual Acer "We don't support software but for $$$ we can help you" I explained there was no software involved in booting.
363	0	0	No, tey don't even support their own bios and it "could be a problem with the bios" How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!
364	0	0	I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION.
365	0	0	But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE!!!
366	0	0	Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time.
367	0	0	This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.
368	0	0	The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.
369	0	0	I'm tired of the inept service.
370	4	0	If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS!!!
371	4	1	Apple is always great about the aesthetics of things, they always come up with good looking products.
372	6	1	It didn't take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation - it's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better.
373	4	1	It's great and we will always stick with Apple###computers, we have been so happy with them.
374	3	1	It has a 10 hour battery life when you're doing web###browsing and word editing, making it perfect for the classroom or office, and in terms of gaming and movie playing it'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours.
375	5	1	However, the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary (unless you're gaming).
376	7	1	i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have.
377	7	0	also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard.
378	5	0	The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare.
379	5	0	I lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening.
380	7	0	Also, the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it.
381	3	1	very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent...
382	3	1	10 hours of battery life is really something else....
383	6	0	tons of bloatware and junk programs.
384	6	0	can't reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers.
385	7	0	keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed.
386	7	0	lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small.
387	4	1	Very happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop!
388	5	1	The touchpad is very intuitive, so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again!
389	6	1	Of course, I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork, GarageBand, and iMovie.
390	2	0	The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets, and rather quickly too.
391	0	0	They told me it was my loss even though it was the computer, not  what I've done.
392	0	0	They told me to reprogram the computer, and I didn't need  to do that, and I lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her  life.
393	4	0	I don't like this company nor the toshiba brand, and I'll never  buy another one because I've put more into it then it is worth.
394	4	0	I would  rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a Toshiba that  isn't good at all.
395	5	0	the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i've ever seen.
396	5	0	sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move.
397	5	0	the mouse buttons are hard to push.
398	4	0	i cant believe HP put this out.
399	4	1	I love HP,, it's the only computer/printer we will buy.
400	0	0	So I called Compaq, and after being on the phone for 3 hours, i finally got a replacement which I shouldn't have had a problem getting since it was under warranty.
401	3	0	2 months later, the battery went.
402	0	0	The people are frustrating to work with, the product itself is very cheaply made, and the accessories are less than satisfactory.
403	2	0	Also, my sister got the exact same laptop (since they were so cheap) and after 8 months, the screen split in half just from everyday use.
404	2	0	After 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off.
405	2	0	It was still working, but there was nothing on the screen.
406	2	0	The screen is framed by half- to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary, reduces the screen size and increases the bulk.
407	7	0	Keyboard could use some trimming.
408	7	0	Did I mention everything about it, from size to weight to keyboard screams BULK?
409	7	1	I especially like the backlit keyboard.
410	6	1	I use iphoto all the time, which is a great program for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike.
411	6	1	The program came with the computer and works beautifully.
412	4	1	I definitely will buy a Mac again if and when this computer ever fails.
413	0	0	I took it to the shop and they said It would cost too much to repair it.
414	1	1	The OS takes some getting used to especially after being a Windows###user for so long but the learning###curve is so worth it!
415	2	1	Lightweight and the screen is beautiful!
416	4	0	You will regret it if you buy any dell.
417	4	0	Dell sucks
418	1	0	I have Vista, so I am unable to install and uninstall  some programs.
419	4	0	In short I would never buy a Compaq again.
420	7	1	The keyboard is top notch.
421	5	1	The touch pad is among the best.
422	4	0	Sorry Toshiba, but 1st impressions do count for something.
423	1	0	A MONTH LATER, we reinstall the OS (Vista).
424	4	1	My house is now 100% Macbook.
425	2	1	The Macbook starts fast, doesn't crash, has a fantastic display, is small and light (I have the 13.3" model), and isn't always complaining about updates, lost connections, errors, blue screens, etc.
426	2	0	I hate the display screen and I have done everything I could do the change it.
427	7	0	The keyboard is too slick.
428	3	0	The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.
429	3	0	Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.
430	2	0	Eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on.
431	4	0	Guess I'll stay away from HP.
432	6	0	The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me, but I have just been using firefox instead.
433	2	1	Its small enough where I can take it pretty much anywhere, but still has a big enough screen to get everything done.
434	6	0	The only thing that I don't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to.
435	6	0	Games being the main issue.
436	6	0	It drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I can't play it because its not compatable with the software.
437	6	0	This computer periodically crashes (Office, IPhoto, Safari).
438	2	0	But if you buy this i would highly recommend that you buy a case and screen protector for this machine as they are known to be quite fragile.
439	2	1	It has a stunning retina###display, and is very fast.
440	2	1	The HD display is sensational, and now watching any movie is a very enjoyable experience for me.
441	3	1	It gives me everything I need from a computer and with the long lasting battery, it also gives me mobility.
442	6	1	No bloatware from third party parasites to uninstall.
443	1	1	The big deal with this was Windows 7.
444	2	1	The retina###display is fantastic.
445	2	0	The glare of the glossy-retina###display is unbearable.
446	4	0	Do not buy a mac until this issue is resolved.
447	7	0	Fantastic for the price - just wish it the keys were illuminated.
448	1	0	Windows runs very poorly.
449	3	1	awesome price for a laptop that lasts more than 8 hours without recharging!
450	1	0	Hate Windows 8.1!
451	7	0	The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is, I feel I have to reach so far to type on the key###board.
452	7	0	You also have to press firmly on the keys.
453	1	0	It also gave me an introduction to Windows 8, which I hope will be discontinued it the future.
454	0	1	They were excellent to handle our return and post our refund back into our account the next day.
455	2	0	Fired up and worked for the first day and then the display died on my wife while she was taking a timed test.
456	2	1	the screen is big, and everything was as described
457	7	0	The keyboard is a little wonky with having to use the Function button to get the F-keys but with how infrequently i use those it is a non-issue.
458	3	1	The battery will get you from LA to NY no problem.
459	2	1	IT IS VERY LIGHT AND THE PICTURE IS NICE  AND THE PRICE WAS AMAZING.
460	7	1	plus this computer comes with a full size keyboard.
461	6	1	NO junkware!!
462	2	0	Screen broke 1 month outside warranty.
463	4	0	Avoid Acer.
464	2	1	Retina###display is beautiful.

466	2	1	It has a wide screen and it's easy to use.
467	5	0	I can't use the Trackpad very well, it's too sensitive, so I hooked up a mouse.
468	1	1	Windows 7 rocks.
469	2	1	Bigger screen than expected, laptop with a desktop design that is really nice to use for all types of usage, including programming/editing
470	1	1	One of the very few laptops still available with Win###7###Pro, multiple USB ports, and a DVD read/write drive.
471	4	1	Great laptop from Apple!

473	3	1	I can easily get 10 hours out of a full charge.
474	2	1	Size is perfect and display is beautiful!
475	2	1	The screen is wide and provides excellent clarity.
476	2	0	So far I do not have any trouble with it other than the picture quality is a bit poor.
477	2	0	So i gave this 4 stars but only because of the poor picture quality, other than that it is a great buy!
478	3	0	The battery life is a joke and it's causing other problems.
479	3	1	This things run smoothly for its price, and the battery life seems to go on forever.
480	7	1	It was nearly impossible to find a laptop that had A) a side keyboard.
481	1	0	The only con is Windows effin 8.
482	2	1	Still giving it a 5 star rating because it is fast and a nice sized screen.
483	3	0	Battery doesn't last long web###browsing (2.5 hours maybe).
484	6	0	It has some bloat wear that I wish weren't there.
485	1	1	The home page/startup is easy to navigate which is the one thing I was mainly concerned about.

487	3	1	The battery is pretty soild.
488	3	1	It lasts up to 5-6 hours with normal use.

490	7	1	My favorite colors black and red, the matte material and the red backlight of the keyboard.
491	2	1	The touch###screen response is fast and it picks up bluetooth and wifi FAST.
492	7	1	I like the number pad for work so that's nice
493	6	0	Only downfall is the preloaded McAfee and other software.
494	2	1	The display is good quality.
495	3	1	The battery seems adequate for most uses ~ 4.5 hour use/charge.
496	2	1	Screen is clear and bright.
497	3	1	Good battery life as well.
498	0	0	Dealing with HP support is a ridiculous and painful experience.
499	0	0	I have spent more than 2.5 hours on the phone with them (over 4 different calls), only to get no where.
500	0	0	Now I'm looking into the return process, which I'm sure will just be loads of fun, if my prior experience is any indication.
501	4	0	Seriously, save yourself the hassle and purchase from a different company.
502	4	0	Used to love HP products, but this has soured me on the whole company.
503	5	0	The mouse pad however is very loud which is why i gave it four stars.
504	7	1	Several other reviewers made comments on the keyboard and now I can understand why --- this keyboard is the nicest to use of any laptop we've ever owned.
505	7	1	I'm a life-long desktop computer user, and the keyboard on this laptop is as close to a "normal" keyboard as I've ever seen.
506	3	1	Battery life is above average, and it charges quickly.
507	7	1	Keyboard is sturdy.
508	4	1	I will be considering Lenovo for all future laptop purchases.
509	3	1	The PC is works well with a good battery and a power###cable, and has a web cam.
510	1	0	Other than a hate of windows 8, she just loves it.
511	2	1	The build is perfect, the screen fantastic, but I do have a bit of a problem with the fact that I have to buy adaptors for nearly everything, from vga cables to ethernet cables, so, almost perfect...
512	2	1	1.Great display.
513	2	1	Love the color accuracy.
514	4	0	I have had Dell Desktops for years, so had no qualms about buying a Dell laptop.
515	4	1	I've always sworn by dell.
516	1	1	So with this new order, all the upgrades and windows 8 really caught my eye and I got this for the long haul.
517	6	0	In addition, no matter what I do to change the settings, add/delete Flash, etc., Firefox hangs on start-up.
518	4	0	It seems like Lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on.
519	7	1	One positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard, which is larger than usual.
520	7	1	It's a pleasure to type on.
521	5	0	Immediately didn't like the track buttons.
522	5	0	They are loud and clunky but I figured I'd get used to it.
523	2	1	I purchased a  Dell###Inspiron I3531-1200BK and so far I love it, this model has a true life monitor, which is worth the extra bucks.
524	5	0	Would be a very nice laptop if the mousepad worked properly.
525	5	0	It was not responsive at all to touch.
526	5	0	And while tapping the mousepad to try to get it to work, your palm would inevitably touch the side which would pull up the side windows and block your ability to find the mouse.
527	7	0	The 'A' key became jammed so that sometimes it wouldn't press in.
528	4	0	Dell claims they test each key with thousands of mechanical key strokes.
529	2	1	It has a decent feel to it, sharp display and is fast enough.
530	5	0	The biggest problem I have is the right side and top of the touchpad is unresponsive.
531	5	0	I have updated the drivers and tweeked every feature available, but nothing has helped.
532	5	0	Also, the touchpad is almost 'sticky', which kind of defeats the purpose of a touchpad.
533	4	0	I would love to keep this laptop, but will be sending it back and looking for a different brand.
534	4	0	No Lenovo for me.
535	3	0	But now I am having battery problems.
536	5	0	Most of the things about the laptop is awesome except the touchpad.
537	1	1	The Windows 8.1 used to boot in just 2s and that was freaking awesome.
538	5	0	But the  touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever I am typing, my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it's really annoying.
539	5	0	I prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad, i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else.
540	5	0	A smaller touchpad would make life easier for Computer Science students or IT people much more easier.
541	4	0	I will never buy another Lenovo anything!
542	5	0	Unless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop, don't buy this.
543	5	0	The touchpad hasn't worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning, I thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads I've worked with have some inherent oddities.
544	5	0	This one however, is now very loose and I have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work, Then suddenly, I can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own.
545	5	0	Today, it hasn't worked at all more than it has.
546	2	1	Can run CS:GO at 60 fps on low settings.
547	1	1	I liked the fact that it came with Windows 7, but also included Windows 8 to install later if I need it.
548	5	1	I use a wireless mouse, but the touch pad and the "red button" in the middle that works like a little "joystick" also work fine.
549	2	1	The screen is good, the whole things is very light and doesn't run hot.
550	6	1	I put that free app on for word###processing and it works like a charm.
551	0	0	Dell support was awful to deal with.
552	1	0	The 8.1 windows is a major disappointment.
553	1	0	Operating a non touch###screen on this system is a royal pain!
554	2	1	The first thing I can say for positive is that the laptop is very light- makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus.
555	7	1	The keyboard is backlit but you have to press the F5 key to turn it on.
556	2	0	used 6 times black screen returned for refund
557	6	0	do not use the facial###recognition
558	1	0	Windows 8 is not supported by a lot of things!
559	1	0	Price is great, wish it didn't have Windows 8, but that is an opinion.
560	4	1	Glad I did so far.
561	3	1	Great battery life.
562	2	1	The screen is great, I don't see the need for a retina###display.
563	2	1	I love the new high retina###display, and because this computer lacks a disc player it makes it significantly lighter.
564	4	1	I tried not to jump on the Apple bandwagon, but... you're just living in denial if you don't.
565	4	1	Happy buying!
566	4	0	etc. but the company and seller lied to you and try to make an extra buck!
567	4	0	Thank you asus.(they don't deserve to be capitalized)
568	4	1	Very great Apple product as expected.
569	3	1	Good battery life.
570	2	1	Great color on screen.
571	2	1	It has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp.
572	1	1	I have to admit that the operating system is different and does take time to learn but I like it.
573	5	0	The touchpad is a little &quot;clunky&quot; for my taste; I use a small external mouse with laptops  in any event.
574	5	0	I also found the track pad irritating until I disabled &quot;pinch zoom.&quot;
575	3	1	Battery life is great - though it is new.
576	0	0	Each time, Apple can only uninstall to original factory settings for me to start over.
577	3	1	Even the battery life is like WOW!
578	3	1	It contains a long battery life, incredible specs, and an overall enjoyable performance.
579	1	1	Upgrading from a toshiba laptop, I am fully impressed with all of the benefits that the mac operating system provides.
580	0	1	They were great.
581	4	1	how could you not love a Mac
582	2	1	love the flip feature and the touch###screen feature.
583	4	1	To a prospective buyer,  08/10/2012  Once you go Mac, you'll never go back.
584	2	1	because it is a touch###screen you don't even need a mouse.
585	7	1	Lastly, because it can flip 360 you can comfortably lay down in bed and have the keyboard facing down as you watch a show closer without having to adjust your sitting position for the keyboard.
586	1	1	I enjoy the simplicity and user-friendly interface of Yosemite.
587	1	1	I'm excited for El Capitan.
588	6	1	The apps are very easy to use.
589	2	1	The resolution is excellent.

594	2	1	The mac is light and so compact I thought I would regret not buying a retina###display, not in the least The mac###pro works just fine.
595	1	1	The OS is easy, and offers all kinds of surprises.
596	6	1	If you want to use the Internet, then you can make your icons jump out from the bottom of the screen, like a magnifying glass is projecting onto the selected icon.
597	2	1	- Touchscreen is great.
598	2	1	The screen definition is superb and it fires up super quick and same to close down.
599	2	1	The screen has an extremely high resolution that I'm very pleased with.
600	3	0	My daughter's MacBook###Air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago.
601	0	0	It took 3 days to make an appointment at the local Apple###store.
602	0	0	I'm not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand $129 for a new battery, $39 to replace it and $139 for a new keyboard.
603	0	0	I could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so I went to the Apple###store myself and asked for a manager.
604	0	0	He explained to me the battery expansion is 'normal'.
605	0	0	Apple doesn't cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their Apple Care.
606	0	0	The battery is simply considered 'consumable' and NOT covered.
607	0	0	I asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the MacBook###Air on the internet with the description that Apple doesn't consider the product defective.
608	0	0	His reply astonished me, looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said: 'Make sure you have your facts straight before you smear!
609	0	0	He didn't specify who are 'they' but from the tone of his voice and his 6'5' posture it indicated something between the SWAT team and a bunch of LAWYERS.
610	4	0	Here is my take on all of this, the business model Apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from China, hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school, call them geniuses, and bully everybody who complains about their product.
611	4	0	Steve###Jobs is dead, so is Apple.
612	4	0	No more Apple devices in my household.
613	2	1	It churns out HD content, runs without many flaws and I've yet to get a virus on a Mac since I started using the platform in the early 1990's.
614	4	1	That's the only issue I've ever had since working on Macs in 1995.
615	4	1	That's a pretty impressive track record don't you think?
616	7	1	I find it much easier to type on and much more durable.
617	3	1	Battery Life- My battery life is really good with this laptop and I have had no problems with it thus far.
618	3	1	I can usually go about 10 hours before I get down to 10% battery life.
619	2	1	The touchscreen and 2-in-1 capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes.
620	3	1	It's also incredibly light, has a battery that can last for days, and looks like a piece of art.
621	7	1	2. Keyboard is great
622	2	1	I wanted a simple Full HD display and this one does its job
623	2	0	2. Viewing###angles are not great.
624	5	0	5. I found the track pad not great.
625	7	0	The wireless keyboard (not bluetooth, but RF) did not pair up with the device.
626	7	0	It still did not pair.
627	7	0	I even ran it as Administrator -- still no effect.
628	7	0	I used the Ctrl-Esc keys while turning on, and still nothing.
629	7	0	It flickers briefly to green before the light goes out.
630	7	0	I still can't pair it.
631	7	0	I don't want to carry around a bluetooth keyboard for a computer whose keyboard is nonfunctional.
632	4	0	But Sony doesn't seem to have addressed it.
633	6	1	Machine is flying and with parallels desktop 8 I have my old PC notebook completely functional on my MBP.
634	2	0	This laptop has no:  - Touchscreen  - Optical Drives (OK, a bit of a stretch, because that would eat up precious space in this monster)  - Swivel or detachable screen
635	5	0	This is really nice, but I HATE the awkward right mouse clicking.. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.. may be the laptop, may be the laptop in conjunction with Windows 8?
636	5	0	Either way, highly annoying.
637	2	1	Love the 360 degree rotation and the touch###screen works great, but a little bit of a learning###curve there too, as sometimes I have to tap a few times to get the exact location I need...
638	5	0	overall it is just my learning a few things than any downfall with the laptop (the mouse was the only negative I could really see)...
639	2	1	I loved playing with it and the touchscreen was great for the windows 8 platform.
640	2	1	It's a great product and would recommend to anyone looking for a transformer or large touchscreen.
641	7	1	I've only had this for a week Overall I like the computer, it's thin &amp; light and The wireless keyboard works great.
642	3	1	It's light, fast and has great battery!!
643	7	1	The backlit keyboard is a nice touch especially.
644	2	1	The screen looked fine to me and wasn't an issue like others have been saying.
645	1	1	Furthermore, Mac###OS###X Mountain Lion's Gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans, which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed.
646	7	1	The keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back-lit, which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing (Typing?).
647	2	1	Overall, the screen resolution, though non-retina, is sufficient for normal web###browsing and work.
648	5	1	The glass track pad is large enough for Apple's highly acclaimed multi-touch gestures for scrolling through web###pages with two fingers, zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers, accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers.
649	5	1	For Windows users switching to a Mac, you can also enable right clicking (known to apple as secondary click) in the system preferences&gt; Mouse and enabling right clicking.
650	6	1	The Mac app###store and iTunes store are phenomenal.
651	6	1	The Mac app###store is your one-stop shop for Mac software, though you can also download software online at your own risk.
652	6	1	There are currently around 10,000 apps on the App###store (and counting...), and billions of songs available for download fro the iTunes store.
653	6	1	iTunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it's simple to use User###Interface.
654	2	0	Glare is also pretty frustrating.
655	4	1	But, hey, it's an Apple.
656	4	1	I wouldn't expect anything less!
657	4	0	If it was possible to give them 0 start, I would have done it.
658	7	0	My Laptop's one of the Key from keyboard came out and it was mechanical failure.
659	0	0	My laptop was under coverage but when I gave it to them for repairs, they quoted me $755 for it.
660	4	0	this company just wants customers' money in their pocket.
661	4	0	they dont care how you feel when they charge you hundreds of hard earned dollars.
662	4	0	I wish this company to go bust.
663	4	0	I will never ever buy any apple product in my life.
664	7	0	Also, and this maybe is another personal quirk, but the keyboard sits a little far back for my taste so my watch scrapes against the edge of the laptop.
665	0	1	If I were to have any technical difficulties, the local apple and contact line were able to help me asap, it was quite impressive.
666	3	0	3. Cannot manually take battery out, unless you work for apple or have the tools
667	1	1	I was pretty skeptical about upgrading to windows 10, but it is pretty awesome.
668	4	1	They really know what they are doing.
669	4	1	If you dont like windows I would suggest trying a Mac.
670	4	1	The investment is worth it.
671	1	1	Mac User###interface is just the best.
672	4	0	Not impressed with Macintosh products.
673	4	0	In fact I am completely frustrated.
674	1	0	Also, many software programs are not compatible with the IOS platform.
675	1	1	The new operating system called Snow###Leopard is installed and ready for use
676	3	1	The battery life has increased from the last version from 4 hours to 7 hours, making it easy for college students to study for extended periods of time without needing a charger.
677	1	1	Reliability: Throughout the past few years, I have had no problems with the MacBook###Pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws.
678	6	1	The processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly.
679	0	1	Pros:  o It usually runs very smoothly, but Apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers.
680	3	1	o It has an extended battery life.
681	1	1	Cons:  o Some people don't enjoy the way the processing system runs, but don't have any issues with getting it to function.
682	3	0	Battery doesn't hold up to what it said in the description but I got it refurb'd and I imagine they swapped out the battery to help cover the costs on the reduced price (Just a guess).
683	2	0	Screen is too small to read and almost impossible to touch  with a normal adult finger.
684	2	0	The brightest screen setting appeared dim in normal room light.
685	7	0	Keyboard is flimsy and mediocre at best.
686	5	0	The touch pad feel is a 4 on scale  1 - 10.
687	2	1	Runs fast, the touch###screen hasn't lost any sensitivity, I'm overall very happy with it.
688	5	0	This one doesn't do that.
689	5	0	The trackpad is pretty crappy - but aren't they all?
690	1	1	IOS does everything its billed to do and much, much more.
691	1	1	Literally every detail has been thought out and designed with the user in mind.
692	1	1	I can't believe how much time it saves me through automatic processes.
693	3	1	The batter lasts as long as claimed.
694	3	1	I get about 5 or so hours playing the sims.
695	3	1	I haven't really officially tested it yet, but it's a long time.
696	3	1	I hate plugging my laptop in because I don't want to leave it on too long and hurt the battery, but with this laptop I rarely have to charge it.
697	2	1	The touchscreen is responsive and even works with my crappy dollar stylus.
698	1	0	The only problem I have is with windows 8.
699	1	0	I hate windows 8.
700	1	0	It made me sign up with Microsoft and sometimes won't let me download things that are harmful to my computer, but that's what anti###virus software is for lol.
701	2	0	I bought my first MacBook exactly 5 months ago and was really happy with my new toy, but what was not my surprise when I turned it on 2 days ago and the screen was completely black.
702	2	0	I can hear the noise of the computer turning on and the lights also turn on but the screen in completely dead.
703	1	1	The simple look of icons and format makes it easy to navigate through programs and download files.
704	0	1	And apple was happy to install the latest osx for free!
705	0	0	The online customer###service was awful.
706	0	0	Gave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile.
707	0	0	No one would ever answer my question as to why I couldn't get another new Macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my Macbook was still under warranty.
708	0	0	As a matter of fact, no matter how many times I asked that question, the employees I spoke purposely ignored it.
709	0	0	They didn't say yes and they didn't say no, they just pretended that I never asked it, which was incredibly frustrating.
710	0	1	I've been to the &amp;#34;genius&amp;#34; bar several times (they have been very nice).
711	1	1	One OS for this platform, no OEM OS paraphernalia and automatic updates.
712	1	1	I'm no power###user, but I have had no learning###curve with the MAC and I don't do anything geeky enough forcing me to learn the OS.
713	6	1	I did buy Office 2008 for the MAC at a very low price to migrate most of my work files for $64 and that was  a steal in my opinion.
714	4	1	Otherwise I am happily a  Mac user.
715	4	1	But Apple does not pretend it has any of these.
716	2	0	The MacBook###Pro 13.3 inch laptop is for those who want to use a Mac, but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution.
717	4	0	So, I'm cooled on Mac buys.
718	0	0	They did not replace the motherboard.
719	0	0	Instead they 'tightened' a loose wire.
720	0	0	It also has a big new scratch on the top cover.
721	0	0	I started it up and it still has the same problem I went in to fix.

727	0	0	They tried to tell me that the battery wasn't covered by the warranty and it costs about $150 to replace.
728	3	0	Other than that battery issue and the battery life does not last too long, I'm pretty happy with the computer.
729	6	0	Opening photoshop takes FOooooooRRREVER, as do all programs that do not begin with an 'i'.
730	1	0	The free upgrade to Mountain###Lion FAILED.
731	2	0	It tried to boot up and the screen just flashed over and over and over again.
732	4	0	I can't believe people like these computers.
733	4	0	Now that they are not virus free (...l) I see absolutely no benefit to Apple###products as they are slower, more expensive, and do not last as long.
734	0	0	HP was NO help.
735	7	0	The lettering wore off the keys, so you better be able to type blind.
736	3	0	The battery lasted 12 months, then pffft.....gone.
737	0	0	The disks I made wouldn't work.....HP support stated &quot;we're a hardware company, not a software company.&quot;
738	4	0	Then there was a power###cord recall....HP never notified us.....and we did register......never again.
739	4	0	I don't have the inclination or time to devote to a companies tech support, search functions, or hold times.....dropped the HP and never looked back.
740	1	1	I can tweet and use Facebook from the sidebar which is really nice.
741	1	1	I also like I have the option to push calendars, photos, and contacts to an iPad, iPod###Touch, or iPhone (if I had any of those).
742	6	0	The only thing I have had trouble with so far is transferring music to iTunes which I would have liked to do though &amp;#34;Home Sharing&amp;#34; (I used iTunes on a computer separate from my Linux computer) but I could not figure that out.
743	6	0	I just ended up using my iPod to transfer my iTunes music and I re-downloaded my Amazon music (losing my ratings).
744	5	0	Received this item and everything is great except that my touchpad is reversed.
745	5	0	To go left I have to go right and vice versa and to go up I have to go down.
746	5	0	When I attach a mouse it's fine but the touchpad is really annoying.
747	5	0	I went through the settings and there isn't a way to fix it.
748	5	0	It's a great laptop, but right now it's annoying to use the touchpad.
